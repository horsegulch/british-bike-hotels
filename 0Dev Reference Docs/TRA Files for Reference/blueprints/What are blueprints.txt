What are Blueprints?
Flask Blueprints let you organize your app into reusable, modular components. Each blueprint can handle a set of related routes and logic (e.g., authentication, routes, reviews, user profiles).
Why use them?
Easier to maintain and scale.
Each feature/section of your app lives in its own file or folder.
Cleaner app.py (just app setup and blueprint registration).
