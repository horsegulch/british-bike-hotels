# New Consolidated Development Plan

This plan combines your existing goals with the expert suggestions from the project summary, prioritizing what will provide the most stability and value next.

### Phase 1: Solidify the Foundation (Immediate Next Steps)

**Goal:** Address the most critical remaining technical debt and suggestions from the project summary. This phase is about making your app stable, testable, and secure.

|Category|Task|Details & Justification|Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Testing**|**Implement a Testing Framework**|[cite_start]Set up a `/tests` directory and write your first tests using `pytest`. **Start with your authentication blueprint (`auth.py`).** Can a user register? Can they log in? Can they log out? This is the most critical user flow and a perfect place to learn testing.|âšª Not Started|
|**Security**|**Add Basic Rate Limiting**|[cite_start]Implement `Flask-Limiter` to protect your login and registration endpoints from brute-force attacks. This is a quick win that adds a professional layer of security.|âšª Not Started|
|**Documentation**|**Enhance the README**|Update your `README.md` with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Include how to set up the `.env` file, install dependencies, and run the Flask app. [cite_start]Good documentation is crucial for long-term maintenance.|âšª Not Started|
|**UX/UI**|**Major Design & Typography Overhaul**|As listed in your roadmap, now is a good time to focus on the visual polish. Evolve the graphic design, adopt a new font pairing, and refine the color palette. [cite_start]This was already in progress and should be seen through.|ðŸŸ¢ In Progress|

### Phase 2: The Social Layer (Building Community)

**Goal:** Implement the "Follow" system, which is the cornerstone of your planned social and engagement features.

|Category|Task|Details & Justification|Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Features**|**'Follow User' System**|Implement the backend logic for this feature. [cite_start]You'll need to update the `User` model to store `following` and `followers` lists and create new API endpoints to handle follow/unfollow actions.|âšª Not Started|
|**Frontend**|**Add Follow Buttons to UI**|Add "Follow" and "Unfollow" buttons to user profile pages and potentially next to user avatars on review cards.|âšª Not Started|
|**Features**|**Basic Activity Feed**|On the user's profile page, implement the "Feed" tab. [cite_start]This should be a simple, reverse-chronological list of routes and reviews created by the users they follow.|âšª Not Started|

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Discovery & Engagement

**Goal:** Make it easier for users to find relevant content and reward them for their contributions.

|Category|Task|Details & Justification|Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Features**|**Geospatial Searching**|This is a major, high-value feature from your roadmap. Add a "Find routes near me" button and a location search bar. [cite_start]This requires creating a **2dsphere** geospatial index in MongoDB and building a new API endpoint.|âšª Not Started|
|**Features**|**User-Curated Collections**|Allow users to create public lists of routes (e.g., "Best Climbs in the Alps"). [cite_start]This encourages deeper engagement and user-generated content curation.|âšª Not Started|
|**Features**|**Achievements/Gamification**|Introduce a simple achievement system. [cite_start]Start with one or two badges (e.g., "First Upload," "Top Reviewer") to reward user contributions and encourage participation.|âšª Not Started|

### Summary of How to Move Forward

1. **Start with Testing:** Before adding any new features, begin **Phase 1** by setting up `pytest` and writing tests for your `auth` blueprint. This will be an invaluable skill and will ensure your most critical feature remains stable.
2. **Continue with Phase 1:** Work through the other items in Phase 1 (rate limiting, documentation, design overhaul) to create a robust and polished application.
3. **Build the Social Core:** Once the foundation is solid, move on to **Phase 2** to build out the follow system and activity feed.
4. **Add Advanced Features:** Finally, tackle the high-impact features in **Phase 3** that will set your application apart.

This consolidated plan provides a clear and logical path that prioritizes stability, security, and then feature development, ensuring your project grows in a healthy and maintainable way.
